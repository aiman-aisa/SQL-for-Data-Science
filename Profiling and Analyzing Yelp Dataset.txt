Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that 
will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. 
For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, 
as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, 
so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and 
analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. 
You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. 
As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, 
so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you 
are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated 
into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use 
any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, 
just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.

In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

***********SQL CODE**********
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM [table_name]
***************************** 
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

***********SQL CODE**********
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))  
FROM [table_name] 
***************************** 

i. Business = 10000 (Primary key: id)  
ii. Hours = 1562 (Foreign key: business_id)  
iii. Category = 2643 (Foreign key: business_id)  
iv. Attribute = 1115 (Primary key: business_id)  
v. Review = 10000 (Primary key: id), 8090 (Foreign key: business_id), 9581 (Foreign key: user_id)    
vi. Checkin =  493 (Foreign key: business_id)   
vii. Photo = 10000 (Primary key: id), 6493 (Foreign key: business_id)  
viii. Tip = 537 (Foreign key: user_id), 3979 (Foreign key: business_id) 
ix. User = 10000 (Primary key: id)
x. Friend = 11 (Foreign key: user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (Foreign key: user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	Somewhat correlate but also depends on how long have they been yelping. Based on the
	results of the query below, user with longer years of yelping combined with high number of
	reviews tends to have more fans.

***********SQL CODE**********	
	SELECT id

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

We chose the city with the highest number of business which is 'Las Vegas' and highest business category in that city is
shopping

Chosen City = 'Las Vegas'
Chosen Category = 'Shopping'
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Based on table output below, we can see that the lower rating business has higher working hours and
working days compared to the higher rating business.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Based on table below, the total review for 4-5 rating is 36 while 2-3 rating business only has 6 reviews. But
we can see that one of the 4-5 rating business has only 4 review which I think due to the nature of the business which
only sell medical equipment.          
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Not really, since the postal code of the two groups are different. But if we try to see the postal code in the maps and we
could do additional analysis based on the location proximities such as avenues or high-traffic streets.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The average rating for the business that still open is higher than the closed business

		Open = 3.679
		Closed = 3.520
         
ii. Difference 2: The average number of review for the business that still open is higher than the closed business

		Open = 31.76
		Closed = 23.20

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the 
Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, 
to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I have two analysis that I would like to do from this datasets:
1) To find out the most successfull business based on category of the business.
2) To predict the number of fans a user will have.

But the 2nd analysis can really just be done using only the user table since the table is already consist enough data
to do the prediction analysis. 

Therefore I will just proceed to prepare datasets for the 1st analysis.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

Data needed for 1st analysis would be business category from the category table, number of business for each category
the average star rating of the business based on category to see how the business perform
, total and average number of reviews based on category to check if the data is relevant and ensure it's not biased.                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+------------------------+-----------------+------------+------------+------------+
| Business_Category      | Num_of_Business | Avg_Rating | Tot_Review | Avg_Review |
+------------------------+-----------------+------------+------------+------------+
| Local Services         |              12 |       4.21 |        100 |       8.33 |
